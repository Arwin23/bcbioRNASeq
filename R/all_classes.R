#' bcbioRnaDataSet
#'
#' S4 class containing RNA-seq counts and metadata generated by
#' [bcbio-nextgen](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.org/).
#'
#' `bcbioRnaDataSet` is a subclass of [SummarizedExperiment] designed to store
#' an RNA-seq analysis. This class contains raw read counts and transcripts per
#' million (TPM) generated by [tximport()].
#'
#' The `metadata` accessor contains:
#'
#' - Sample summary statistics (a.k.a. metrics).
#' - Ensembl annotations.
#' - Server run paths.
#' - R local environment information, including [sessionInfo()].
