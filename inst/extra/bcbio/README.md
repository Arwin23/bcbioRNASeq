## Example data

This data repository contains example output (2 vs. 2 samples) from a [bcbio](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io) RNA-seq analysis. It is used to test the code integrity of our [bcbioRnaseq](https://github.com/hbc/bcbioRnaseq) R package. Example RMarkdown knit reports in HTML format are generated each time a new build of the package passes integrity checks.
