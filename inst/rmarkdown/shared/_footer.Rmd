# Methods

RNA-seq counts were generated by [bcbio][] and [bcbioRNASeq][] [@Steinbaugh2018-rc] using [Salmon][] [@Patro2017-pi]. Counts were imported into [R][] using [tximport][] [@Soneson2016-tu] and [DESeq2][] [@Love2014-sq]. Gene annotations were obtained from [Ensembl][]. Plots were generated by [ggplot2][] [@Wickham2009-si]. Heatmaps were generated by [pheatmap][] [@Kolde2015-dy].
