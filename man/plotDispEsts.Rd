\title{Plot Dispersion Estimates}
\usage{
\S4method{plotDispEsts}{bcbioRNASeq}(object, ymin, CV = FALSE,
  genecol = "black", fitcol = "red", finalcol = "dodgerblue",
  legend = TRUE, xlab, ylab, log = "xy", cex = 0.45, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object.}

\item{ymin}{the lower bound for points on the plot, points beyond this
are drawn as triangles at ymin}

\item{CV}{logical, whether to plot the asymptotic or biological
coefficient of variation (the square root of dispersion) on the y-axis.
As the mean grows to infinity, the square root of dispersion gives
the coefficient of variation for the counts. Default is \code{FALSE},
plotting dispersion.}

\item{genecol}{the color for gene-wise dispersion estimates}

\item{fitcol}{the color of the fitted estimates}

\item{finalcol}{the color of the final estimates used for testing}

\item{legend}{logical, whether to draw a legend}

\item{xlab}{xlab}

\item{ylab}{ylab}

\item{log}{log}

\item{cex}{cex}

\item{...}{further arguments to \code{plot}}
}
\value{
\code{ggplot}.
}
\description{
A simple helper function that plots the per-gene dispersion
estimates together with the fitted mean-dispersion relationship.
}
\details{
This plot shows the dispersion by mean of normalized counts. We expect the
dispersion to decrease as the mean of normalized counts increases.

Here we're generating a \code{DESeqDataSet} object on the fly, which already has
method support for plotting dispersion, provided by the DESeq2 package.
