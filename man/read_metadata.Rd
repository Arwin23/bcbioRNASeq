\usage{
read_metadata(file, pattern = NULL, pattern_col = "description",
  lanes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Metadata file. CSV and XLSX formats are supported.}

\item{pattern}{Apply grep pattern matching to samples}

\item{pattern_col}{Column in data frame used for pattern subsetting}

\item{lanes}{Number of lanes used to split the samples into technical
replicates. This assumes the file names don't include `_L001` suffix.
Therefore, it renames both the file name and description columns to match
the bcbio YAML. This workflow is commonly used by Harvard Biopolymers
Facility. We can decide to either combine counts at the server level using
`cat` in bash, or we can run DESeq2 later by pooling the counts with
`deseq_lane_pool()`. We may want to deprecate this method in the future and
simply combine counts at the server level for all lane split runs.}
